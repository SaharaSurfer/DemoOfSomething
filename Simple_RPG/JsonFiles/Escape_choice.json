    "1": "You strain your ears to catch the distant conversations of your captors. Judging by their screams and indignation, they are gambling, but meanwhile you can hear them discussing the role of their guild accomplice who participated in your capture. The conversation is cryptic, revealing that one of your own betrayed you, but it remains uncertain who exactly was responsible for your capture.",
